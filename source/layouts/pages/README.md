# **TraLogFin: Thesis**

Having two sides to a story is beneficial for a productivity feedback loop. The trick is to balance out the two.
How can you keep the essence of simplicity whilst maintaining the general fairness between the opposing sides.

## Track a Day

> What's your vocation? - `.established` & `.freelancing`

**Solution/Purpose**
Frustrated with spreadsheets and done with guesswork?
Discipline gets rewarded because it benefits all parties.
Just track your time, and let the numbers speak for themselves.

## Log a Ticket

> What's your position? - `.manager` & `.employee`

**Solution/ Purpose**
No one likes filling out tickets.
Until we simplify it it for easy validation.
Making it so easy to become fun over a while.

## Find a Link

> What's your occupation? - `.specialist` & `.technician`

**Solution/Purpose**
Instantly access all base links if the company.
Applications streamlined like a highway pit stop for links.
Track the inner workings of the business while streamlining workflows.

What's the best way to approach this balance?

# **TraLogFin: Characters**

The core of any sustainable productivity loop is its ethical geometry. It requires the simultaneous maintenance of Output Integrity and Effort Economy. The challenge is to wield simplicity as a boundary condition: using it to constrain complexity and protect the process, thereby establishing a fairness that is defined not by excess effort, but by the precise delivery of the essential. I'm creating a fiction work environment to demo test my REACT application. There's already 18 portraits but need to create fictional information to correlate it with the information the online database will need. So, let's focus more on the backstory for these characters because I already have 18 portraits of characters of different ethnicities.
