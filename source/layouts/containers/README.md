# Containers

This project employs a refined system of visual states to orchestrate user attention and establish a clear hierarchy within your **source layout containers** folder.
These containers, residing in `source/layouts/container/`, include:

- `Overlay`
- `Leftbar`
- `Rightbar`
- `Header`
- `Main`
- `Footer`
